    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>My goal for my website is to be a conventional portfolio for myself. I don’t have the goal to attract a lot of user’s to the page for an artificial or business reason. The main reason is to showcase my talents, skills, and knowledge that I have gained throughout my college education. As such I have a resume with my past job experience, I have some pages showing some of my ability to code javascript. Lastly, I have links from the main web pages to the important sites that employers would need to go to in order to see all the rest of my personal projects in python, C, Clojure, etc. I have ways for those who see the website to get back in touch with me if they are interested and or send me files. Later, when I have a personal server, I will expand this webpage to have some tools that others can come and use such as a file uploader and sender (my own personal). To summarize, shorterm; I see this webpage being more of a resume where only a select few will visit (mainly employers who I have given the link to). Long Term, as I can expand and add onto the webpage, then I can start making it more known so others will want to visit.

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">[#000000]</td>
        <td class="secondary">[#00FFFF]</td>
        <td class="accent1">[#FFFFFF]</td>
        <td class="accent2">[#808080]</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
    <!-- The fonts will be the exact same just because I don't really care for a certain font haha-->
    <h4>Fonts: Default, Times New Roman</h4>

    <!-- ------------------------Step 13------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
    <nav>
      <a href="#">Home</a>
      <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/HTML/webpage/webpage.html">Cool Webpage</a>
