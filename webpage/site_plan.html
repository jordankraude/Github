    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>My goal for my website is to be a conventional portfolio for myself. I don’t have the goal to attract a lot of user’s to the page for an artificial or business reason. The main reason is to showcase my talents, skills, and knowledge that I have gained throughout my college education. As such I have a resume with my past job experience, I have some pages showing some of my ability to code javascript. Lastly, I have links from the main web pages to the important sites that employers would need to go to in order to see all the rest of my personal projects in python, C, Clojure, etc. I have ways for those who see the website to get back in touch with me if they are interested and or send me files. Later, when I have a personal server, I will expand this webpage to have some tools that others can come and use such as a file uploader and sender (my own personal). To summarize, shorterm; I see this webpage being more of a resume where only a select few will visit (mainly employers who I have given the link to). Long Term, as I can expand and add onto the webpage, then I can start making it more known so others will want to visit.

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">[#000000]</td>
        <td class="secondary">[#00FFFF]</td>
        <td class="accent1">[#FFFFFF]</td>
        <td class="accent2">[#808080]</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
    <!-- The fonts will be the exact same just because I don't really care for a certain font haha-->
    <h4>Fonts: Default, Times New Roman</h4>

    <!-- ------------------------Step 13------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
    <nav>
      <a href="#">Home</a>
      <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/HTML/webpage/webpage.html">Cool Webpage</a>
      <a href="#">Contact Us</a>

    <h2>Main page</h2>
    <h4>Why?</h4>
    <p>People will come to my site to see the many different tools and coding projects that I will
      add over time. My site will be almost like a personal github repository where it will showcase all
      of the different things that I can do and people will come to use those tools, send me ideas, or
      offer jobs. The main purpose of the site is to allow future employers to see my skill set and so they
      will come to view my showcase skills (shown through projects, etc.).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Questions</h4>
    <p>The main question that those who come to my site will be "what can I gain from here? Is there anything
      useful?" They will expect my site to answer those questions if I can be of use or if any of my projects 
      can be of use.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>No Competition</h4>
    <p>There isn't a concept of competition for my website. I am not trying to get people to my website to sell
      anything or show them ads that will make me money. The sole benefit of this website to me is the information 
      that it can give me or the opportunities/jobs that it might bring me. So there is no reason why someone would 
      choose this site over github. The people who come to my site will be those who have met me physically or seen
      my accounts on social media (Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, etc.)
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Second Page</h2>
    <h4>Utility</h4>
    <p>Visitors on my site will want to share files, get in contact with me, or just have a good time maybe
      playing some of the games that I will eventually put on. Anyone who visits will also be able to learn
      and gain new skills on their own because the site is supposed to be like an abundance of information 
      for everyone who wants to come.

    <br>
    <h2>Final Page</h2>
    <h4>Need to Know</h4>
    <p>I think the only thing that people might need to know is my email to complete the things I have for them. 
      Everyone who does come should know exactly why they are coming to the website. They will just need to know my
      email if they want to send me files. I currently do not have my own backend and github doesn't run php or python
      or any other type of code embeded. So I have to run this part of the webpage (the file sender) through a third party
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>More To Come</h4>
    <p>This webpage is a constant work in progress. I first started working on this webpage when I was learning HTML over the
      summer of 2021. I have since learned and added things showcasing the new skills. One example can be how the newer pages will
      have a better layout because I have since learned about grids and wireframes. Some of the subpages will be in a very primitive
      format. Not because I am lazy now but because it shows my progress. On the same topic as mentioned above, things will continue
      to be added such as games, projects, etc. This will happen more frequent as I eventually get out of college and get my own
      backend for this page.
