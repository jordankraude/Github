        Hi! My name is Jordan Kraude. This is the first webpage that I have ever created. I wanted to make this so that I can add on to it and
        show who I am and what I can do for the moment. A little about me. I was born in California then we moved when I was little to the midwest.
        we lived there until I turned 14 then we moved back to California. I am big into sports, music, movies, kayaking, coding, cooking,
        baking, and learning new things. <em>I have always tried to be the best at everything I am doing and improve everyday. At the moment I
        am studying computer science at BYU Idaho maintaining a 4.0 GPA through 40 credits. I am fairly new to most languages but I am at least knowledgable and can
        write in Javascript, Python, and HTML. I hope you like my website and the things I showcase here.</em>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Pro Wide Drywall <address>Apprentice (06/2016-08/2016)</address></h3>
        At Pro Wide Drywall I was a apprentice. I was with my employer and teacher Jesus during most of my
        time while working for Pro Wide. I was in charge of learning the skills and goings of drywall including,
        laying and cutting drywall, taping and mudding, caulking, and spraying the final texture. <b>Overall my main
        responsibility can be summarized by saying I was responsible to learn and pay attention.</b>
        <h3>Newland Interiors <address>Team Leader (06/2017-08/2017)</address></h3> 
        I was given tasks at Newland Interiors that I then delegated to my team members to accomplish before the
        date in which we needed to be finish. <b>I coordinated and worked with the project manager and gave reports
        on our team and our progress.</b> We were given tasks to demolish and refurnish rooms which included taking out
        old furniture, beds, and bad electrical. <b>We needed to carry heavy equipment</b> and work power tools. 
        <h3>Spray and Son Janitorial <address>Crew Worker (05/2018-08/2018)</address></h3> 
        At Spray and Son I worked as part of a team to finish our weekly cleaning tasks in a timely manner.
        <b>Basic janitorial skills were needed and were learned.</b>
